## v5.10.0

* Fixed issues with update notifications
* Fixed issue with extremely slow plot clearing

## v5.10.1

* Fixed updater issue caused by the Spigot API returning 5.1 not 5.10 for the version.
* Updated default config value for plot biome to match the format WorldEdit accepts, and fix incorrectly formatted existing config values.

## v5.10.2

* Update notifications are now polled every 30 minutes, and only congratulates for running the latest version once. No longer polls every time a player with permissions joins when update checking is enabled either.
* Fix getting plot comments.
* Fix null errors with PlaceholderAPI. Also sure up some of the logic so that even if the player is not in a plot, relevant placeholders can still be used.

## v5.10.4

* Added Paper-specific listeners (configurable) to:
  - Prevent mobs from leaving the plot by wandering out
  - Improve mob spawn prevention performance
* Reduce default update poll rate even more (default 6 hrs, with config option)
* LiquidFlow flag enabled will override block physics denied
* Flag names must be 64 characters or less (should allow for older Database schemas to not error)
* Plotworlds with plot + road size less than 16 will no longer cause generation issues.

*This version also contains the following changes:*

* Add config option to disable polling after an update is found (will also no longer print updates to console). Players in-game will still receive the prompt.
* Correctly detect when a newer version is available to counter Spigot's API lag
* LiquidFlow flag is now an enum with three values: default, enabled and disabled
* Bring SpawnReasons up-to-date with what's in Spigot
* Plot expiry messages are now clickable to run commands
* Plot setup will correctly display the world type options

## v5.10.5

* Fix errors during plot analysis
* Correctly display grants used and grants remaining
* Fix grants when using /plot auto
* Fix block tags (#buttons) when used in flags after restarting server
* Fix /plot merge all
* Don't send chat spy to message sender

## v5.11.0

This is a larger update. It is highly recommend that you read through the linked material. Please note that the backup system is enabled by default, and will delay `/plot clear` and `/plot set <component>` until a snapshot has been taken of the plot. This can be disabled in the settings file.

If you have extremely big plots (>200 blocks in width) you should probably disable automatic backups.

*If you're going to use the backup system together with FAWE, please update to the latest FAWE build!*

*New Features*:

* Added plot backups https://wiki.intellectualsites.com/en/plotsquared/backups
* Added a `keep-inventory` flag
* Added a way to disable certain blocks from being used in `/plot set` (in settings.yml) (https://i.imgur.com/pO0grZd.png). By default this includes: https://pastie.io/qhceln.txt
* Added a new wiki page for `/plot set`: https://wiki.intellectualsites.com/en/plotsquared/plot-settings
* Added command completions for `/plot set`: https://i.imgur.com/kNz3zks.png
* Added updated French translations

*Fixes*:

* Fixed slime navigation bug
* Fixed potential issue with our entity combat listener
* Fixed `/plot merge auto`

## v5.11.1

This update focuses a lot on the chunk processor and I have therefore updated its wiki page: https://wiki.intellectualsites.com/en/plotsquared/optimization/chunk-processor. This system is quite handy if your server suffers from large tile entity counts, and now it now works properly again.

*Additions*:

* Added the flag `prevent-creative-copy` to prevent people from copying NBT data in the plot
* Added the option to enable the tile entity check on block placement when using Paper
* Added a new bStats chart for tracking FAWE usage

*Changes*:

* (Currently WE only - Not FAWE compatible) Updated the WE listener to correctly limit tile entities, and make the limit apply per chunk rather than per edit
* Made `/plot set <component>` respect the tile entity limit
* Updated the chunk manager code
* Allow `/plot auto` from non-plot areas if the server only has one plot area
* Copy NBT data on plot move, swap, etc

*Fixes*:

* Fixed the update notifier for the 950th time
* Fixed an issue where `/plot set ##*category` would bypass the blacklist
* Fixed an issue where the tile entity and entity limit would delete all entities in the chunk
* Fixed an issue where style.yml wouldn't update the default values
* Made `/plot setbiome` properly load chunks before updating the biome
* Made `/plot clear` empty tile entities before removing them

*If you are using FastAsyncWorldEdit, please update to the latest FAWE build, as PlotSquared's chunk manager has changed*

## v5.12.0

_Due to changes to plot components in this version, it is highly recommended using the latest version of FastAsyncWorldEdit (If you want to use FAWE)._

## Major Changes

### Single Plot Area

This version makes it a lot easier to create [Single Plots](../customization/single-plot-area.md). in a non-plot world, making use of the WorldEdit selection want. You can now create plots anywhere you like and leverage the power of PlotSquared in all your worlds.

### Plot Component GUI

PlotSquared now allows you to create [Component Presets](../customization/plot-components.md) that can be used through a GUI.

### UUID System Remake

We have rewritten our UUID handling from scratch, and UUID to username mapping should be a lot more reliable going roward. This should be able to resolve all issues with "Unknown" plot members, owners, etc.

When you run the usernames automatically from different sources (in the given order):

* In memory cache
* New user_data.db (SQLite cache)
* Legacy userdata.db (SQLite cache)
* Bukkit offline players / Paper profiles
* (Optional) Essentials user files
* (Optional) LuckPerms user data
* (Optional) BungeePerms user data
* Mojang API

The first time you run PlotSquared v5.12.0 it might have to run for an extended amount of time, depending on the amount of missing UUIDs on your server. The reason it's particularly slow in this case is because Mojang enforces a very restrictive rate limit on the amount of requests we can make. When this entire process has been completed once, PlotSquared will be able to index thousands of UUIDs in a matter of seconds.

_If you run an offline-mode server without BungeeCord, your old UUID cache may no longer be functional, which means that everyone will be listed as "Unknown" until they join the server for the first time. If this happens, please contact us on Discord so we can evaluate your particular setup and hopefully remedy the issue._

This also means that you can add people to plots, make them owners etc, even if they have never been on the server before.

## Other Changes

### Features

* Added a new internal world management system.
* Added tab completion for `/plot visit`.
* Added tab completion for `/plot list`.
* Added tab completion for `/plot <add|trust|deny|kick|remove>`.
* Added support for asynchronous tab completion (Paper only).
* Added `/plot toggle debug` which will inform plot owners and administrators when flags are changing the outcome of events

### Changes

* Switched issue tracker. We now use [YouTrack](https://issues.intellectualsites.com/projects/ps).
* PlotSquared will now register itself in `bukkit.yml`, which should resolve issue where worlds were not recognized as plot worlds.
* Make large operations less prone to crash the server.
* Moved the cuboid operation method, this now means that FAWE can take control of operations like `/plot set`.
* Switch out the internal plot area mappings and use an [R-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree). This will perform better when a world has a large amount of plot areas.
* Greatly improve the plot area API.
* Add a plot query API and use it internally.
* Overhauled the internals of the `/plot setup` command. It also got some tab completion e.g. for blocks.
* Made the list of command aliases that the paper command completer will act on.

### Fixes

* Fixed issues with schematic saving ([#2836](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/PlotSquared/commit/d5d18a60fb68e95115a1f8678043e6f01a76d328)).
* Fixed an issue where plot chat was not send to actor when plot chat spy activated ([#PS-7](https://issues.intellectualsites.com/issue/PS-7)).
* As a consequence of the new UUID system, "unknown" should not be an issue anymore.
* Fixed issues where visit would bring you to the wrong player's plot.
* Fixed an issue where merging plots would generate the plot blocks on road height instead of plot height ([#PS-46](https://issues.intellectualsites.com/issue/PS-46))
* Correct the the keep-commands sent during expiration.

## v5.12.1

This version is a minor hotfix in regards to v5.12.0

*Changes:*

* This version fixes an issue where old player objects were not cleaned up properly. This is caused by an issue with the event order in Spigot (and Spigot derivatives).
* Issues relating commands not working have been resolved as well.

## v5.12.2

This update focuses a lot on 1.16 with all its new features and enhancements.

https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/plotsquared-v5.77506/update?update=346686

**Warn:** If `/plots home` does not function, please delete your `plugins/PlotSquared/config/commands.yml` file.

**TIP:** Check the new syntax: [/p home](https://wiki.intellectualsites.com/en/plotsquared/commands-and-permissions#home) and [/p visit](https://wiki.intellectualsites.com/en/plotsquared/commands-and-permissions#visit). The new placeholders are described at [here](https://wiki.intellectualsites.com/en/plotsquared/placeholders).

This setting is enabled by default, however, you can simply disable it if you don't use PlotSquared placeholder with FeatherBoard or don't want to use FeatherBoard's build in placeholders and simply use it with PlaceholderAPI, that works as well.
* Added a debug (`/plot toggle debug`) onto `onBlockIgnite` event notifying players to set the `block-ignition` flag when using flint and steel before cancelling the event.
* Added a debug (`/plot toggle debug`) onto `onEntityBlockForm` event notifying players if the `ice-form` flag is not set before cancelling the event.

## v6.0.0

## Settings.yml Changes:

The following entries have been removed or altered and can be deleted safely from the file.

### Removed:

* The option `web.assets` has been removed due the asset interface no longer existing within v4 and v5.
* The option `chat.console_color` has been removed. PlotSquared now respects legacy and adventure components properly and will always send the correct colors.
* The options `uuid.use-sqluuidhandler`, `enabled_components.per-world-visit`, `chunk.block-cache`, `enabled_components.permission-cache`, `chat.interactive` have been removed due to serving no purpose anymore.
* The category `chat` has been removed.
* The standalone option `titles` has been moved into its own configuration block alongside its new options.

### Additions:

The following entries have been added. This process is done automatically on the first start up of v6.

* The option `enabled-components.default-locale` was added. The specified value will be used to find the correct translation file.
* The option `enabled-components.per-user-locale` was added. When enabling it, PlotSquared will send texts in the user's locale if translations exist.
* The options `teleport.on-clear` and `teleport.on-delete` determining whether the user should be teleported upon clearing or deletion.
* The options `timeformat.date-format` and `timeformat.time-zone` have been added formatting the plot creation date placeholder and the appearance in `/plot info`. Editing the format does not affect the storage date.
* Added the options `titles.titles-fade-in`, `titles.titles-stay`, `titles.titles-fade-out` and `titles.titles-as-actionbar` making plot titles duration customizable and allowing you to opt in plot titles send as actionbar message.
* The former option `titles` has been transformed into `titles.display-titles`.
* The option `ratings.block-0` to 8 has been added determining the blocks to use for the `/plot rate` GUI.
* The option `chat.log-plotchat-to-console` has been added declaring whether the plot chat should be logged to console or not.
* The option `chat.notification-as-actionbar` has been added determining whether notification flags, such as notify-enter, notify-leave, greeting or farewell should send an actionbar message over a regular chat message.

## Worlds.yml Changes:

* The option `plot.sign_material` (respectively `plot.legacy_sign_material` for versions equal to 1.13) has been added allowing you to change the material of plot signs.
* Within the removal of the Nashorm scripting engine and the switch to [WorldEdit Expressions](https://worldedit.enginehub.org/en/latest/usage/other/expressions/). Expression in prices are no longer formed with `+{arg}+` but `+{plots}+` making it more intuitive to use. The conversion is done automatically by PlotSquared if such a field is detected. If you used JS functions like `Math.pow()` before, you'll need to update that manually. For help with that, look at the WorldEdit wiki or ask on our discord.

## Translation Changes:

* PlotSquared uses Adventure as of v6 to handle translations and support hex color codes, gradients, etc. Get an [explanation](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage.html#color) how to apply it.
* We are now available on Crowdin Enterprise to manage our translations. Help us [translate PlotSquared](https://intellectualsites.crowdin.com/plotsquared) into your language.
* You can change the language of PlotSquared in the settings.yml, with the key `<key>`. You don't need to rename any files anylonger.
* Translations are located in the `lang` folder. You can safely delete the old `translations` folder, it's no longer needed.

## Permission Changes:

____
Within PlotSquared v6, permissions are no longer granted by default if the person is an operator (/op [player]). PlotSquared comes with a complex permission system that *should* be used with a permission management software, such as [LuckPerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms.28140/).
However, you can grant people all PlotSquared permissions with the node `plots.*`.
____

### Single permission changes

#### Additions:

* The permission `plots.admin.music.other` has been added. It allows you to use `/plot music` on foreign plots.
* The permission `plots.visit.denied` has been added. Without the permission, players cannot visit plots they are denied on.
* The permissions `plots.add.<amount>`, `plots.trust.<amount>` and `plots.deny.<amount>` have been added. They are working in the same way like the range-typic permissions of `plots.plot.<amount>` do; you specify the amount within the permission node.
* The permission `plots.admin.flight` has been added to bypass the `fly` flag.
* The permission `plots.flag.notify-leave.bypass` has been added. `plots.flag.notify-enter.bypass` does no longer cover both types.
* The permission `plots.admin.components.other` has been added as administrative override to use `/plot components` on plots you don't own but need to administer.
+
#### Changes:
* `/plot flag remove <flag>` now requires the permission node `plots.flag.remove`. Previously it was inherited by `plots.flag.add`.
* The permission `plots.admin.command.unlink` has been fixed.
* The permission `plots.set.alias` has been replaced with `plots.alias.set`
* The permission `plots.admin.command.rate` has been replaced with `plots.admin.command.purge.ratings`.
* The permission `plots.admin.command.chat` has been replaced with `plots.admin.command.chatspy`
* The command `/plot toggle <attribute>` now requires the base permission `plots.toggle` too.
+
#### Removal:
* The permission `plots.list.unknown` has been removed.
* The permission `plots.admin.command.update` has been removed.

### Permission pack changes

All `plotme.<pack>` packs have been removed. Below we will list the new pack that replaces the removed permission pack or the permission node to assign.
Note: If you didn't use the old PlotMe permissions before, you can ignore the following table!

* The placeholder `%plotsquared_currentplot_creationdate%` has been added showing the plot creation date. You can customize the format in the settings.yml timeformat section.
* The placeholders `%plotsquared_currentplot_members_trusted_list%`, `%plotsquared_currentplot_members_added_list%` and `%plotsquared_currentplot_members_denied_list%` have been added displaying a list of added/trusted/denied people.

### Changes:

* `%plotsquared_currentplot_world%` has been renamed to `%plotsquared_currentplot_world_name%`
* `%plotsquared_has_build_rights%` has been renamed to `%plotsquared_currentplot_can_build` matching more appropriately `/plot info`
* `%plotsquared_allowed_plot_count%` now returns `infinite` if you have * permission

## Command changes

* The command `/plot save` has been removed and replaced by Arkitektonika usable via `/plot download` ingame.
* The command `/plot download` has been overhauled with Arkitektonika. You now receive a deletion key alongside the download URL to delete the schematic whenever you want.
* The command `/plot wea` has been removed due deprecation and is superseded by `/plot toggle worldedit`. Alternative aliases are `/plot toggle wea` or `/plot toggle we`.
* `/plot help` now supports tab completion of categories and notifies the user if they cannot access certain help pages.

## Usability changes

* Tab completion has been added to (almost) all commands suggesting proper arguments if the user has permission.
* Vault is now being used as default currency allowing other plugins to provide their own currency ($, €, etc.)
* Destructive plot commands, such as `clear` or `delete` have been removed from plot worlds plots.
* A variety of plot commands now include the plot ID when running commands, e.g `/plot clear` or `/plot set biome`
* Plot world plots now use an underscore (`_`) as index separator instead of a (semi)colon.
* `/plot setowner` now respects grants

## Flag changes

### Additions:

* The flag `leaf-decay` has been added determining whether leaves should decay or not. The flag is set to true by default, you need to set it via `/plot flag set leaf-decay false` to stop leaves from decaying.
* The flag `fall-damage` has been added determining whether an entity or a player should take fall damage.
* The flag `crop-grow` has been added determining whether an crops can grow or not.
* The flags `deny-portals` and `deny-portal-travel` have been added determining whether portals can be created or not and can be used.
* The flag `deny-portal-travel` has been added determining whether players can travel thru portals across dimensions.
* The flag `lectern-read-book` has been added determining whether players can open lecterns to read books. Note: This requires the `use` flag set with `lectern` input.
* The flag `entity-change-block` has been added allowing to control misc entity events in a more controllable way, e.g if a player jumps on a big dripleaf.

### Changes:
* The flag `weather` now solely takes the couple of inputs `rain` and `clear` matching the vanilla naming scheme.
