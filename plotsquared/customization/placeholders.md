# Placeholders

## Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
The placeholder integration allows you to display data from other plugins in specific locations in PlotSquared.
{% endhint %}

For example, with [FeatherBoard](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/2691) you can create a scoreboard (sideboard) with the info about the plot you're standing on. And with using [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/6245), you can do `/plot flag set greeting Welcome %player_name%` which translates to "Welcome Steve" when the player Steve enters a plot. +
The `Player` expansion from PlaceholderAPI is required to be installed.

Currently, (FeatherBoard and) PlaceholderAPI placeholders, can be used in the `greeting` and `farewell` flag of a plot.

## Setup

PlotSquared has explicit and official support for [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/6245) and [MVdWPlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/11182).

Follow the instruction of these placeholder systems to install it correctly.

{% hint style="info" %}
For the PlaceholderAPI placeholders of PlotSquared you don't need to download a PAPI expansion. As opposed to some other plugins, PlotSquared handles everything internally.
{% endhint %}

## Placeholder Deactivation in PlotSquared

Placeholders can be turned off in `settings.yml`:

```yaml
  external-placeholders: false
```

## Tips for specific plugins

### Chat-System

If you're using **EssentialsChat** and **PlaceholderAPI**, you must install [ChatInjector](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/38327) in order for the placeholders to show up in the chat. However, please note it has been reported that ChatInjector might cause issues.
