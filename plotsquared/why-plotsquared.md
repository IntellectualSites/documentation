# Why should you switch to PlotSquared?

## Support

* Works on SpigotMC and PaperMC server systems
* Support for Minecraft 1.13.2 to 1.21.x
* Works with offline-mode servers
* Is considered a world generator and is therefore supported by most world management tools, such as [MultiverseCore](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/390)
* [Community Translations](https://intellectualsites.crowdin.com/plotsquared)
* Fast [Discord](https://discord.gg/intellectualsites) support
* Very popular for the players

## Speed

* Plots are cleared asynchronously and are therefore particularly high-performance
* Auto-plotting doesn't lag or crash the server
* Much faster chunk generation, plot moving, swapping + everything
* Supports huge plot sizes (e.g. 1024x1024 of custom terrain)
* Works with hundreds of thousands of plots

## Reduce Lag

* Optional plot purging and old plot removal
* Optional dynamic world border and world chunk trimming
* Optional Redstone clock prevention
* Mass plot condensation
* Mob limiting

## Safety

* Distinction between different [membership tiers](plot-membership-tiers.md)
* Per plot use / interact flags for different materials and some other restrictions via [plot flags](plot-flags.md)
* Reliable [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) / [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/13932) restrictions
* Reliable [FastAsyncVoxelSniper](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/fastasyncvoxelsniper) restrictions also apply when using FAWE
* Chunk and WorldEdit processor to prevent lag, crashes and data corruption
* Many permissions
* Lots of redundancies. e.g. Backup your database with `/plot database`, or if you lose both, you can still recover based on plot sign information

## Looks

* Add amazing roads schematics and plot schematics to existing worlds
* All messages are customizable with [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html) support
* Titles (entry notifications)
* Per plot time / weather / music and more via [plot flags](plot-flags.md)

## Features

* Plot merging, moving and plot switching
* Extensive flag system (~100+ flags)
* Plot clusters in normal worlds
* Augmented generation (e.g. Vanilla, Islands, TerrainControl)
* PlotSquared Web interface with plot info
* Plot components with percent composition control
