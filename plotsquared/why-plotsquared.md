# Why should you switch to PlotSquared?

## Speed

* Async: clear plots more than 800 times faster than PlotMe
* Plot auto doesn't lag or crash the server
* Much faster chunk generation, plot moving, swapping + everything
* Supports huge plot sizes (e.g. 1024x1024 of custom terrain)
* Works with hundreds of thousands of plots

## Reduce lag

* Plot purging and old plot removal
* Optional dynamic world border and world chunk trimming
* Mass plot condensation
* Redstone clock prevention
* Mob limiting

## Safety

* You can safely allow redstone, tnt without worrying about lag, griefing from sand cannons, pistons, tnt, ...
* You have a reliable [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) / [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fast-async-worldedit.13932) restriction
* Chunk and WorldEdit processor to prevent lag, crashes and data corruption
* Lots of redundancies. e.g. Backup your database with `/plot database`, or if you loose both, you can still recover based on plot sign information.

* Add amazing roads schematics and plot schematics to existing worlds
* Easily change the message color scheme
