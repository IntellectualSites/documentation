# Plot flags

## Introduction

The extensive flagging system allows you to do all sorts of things such as setting the plot weather.

Setting a flag is easy, just use `/plot flag set <flag> <value>`. For a boolean flag, the value would either be 'true' or 'false'.

## Flag List

To bring up a list of flags use `/plot flag list`. These values are clickable, and clicking a flag name will show you information about that particular flag. You can also use `/plot flag info <flag>` directly, if you already know the flag name.

## Default Plot and Road Flags

You can set default flags per world in the `plugins/PlotSquared/config/worlds.yml`. Default flags will be present in each claimed plot unless a different value is manually set for that plot.

The following is an **example** of setting the `use` flag to allow interaction with doors, and trapdoors, levers, gates, pressure plates, buttons and trip wires:

```yaml
worlds:
  <world>:
    [...]
    flags:
      use: "oak_door,iron_trapdoor,lever,acacia_fence_gate,light_weighted_pressure_plate,oak_button,tripwire"
      pvp: true
```

_`<world>` indicates the name of that plotworld._

You can use [Vanilla block tags](vanilla-tags.md) too.

The same works for road flags.

**Example:**

```yaml
worlds:
  <world>:
    [...]
    road:
      [...]
      flags:
        use: "oak_door,iron_trapdoor,lever,acacia_fence_gate,light_weighted_pressure_plate,oak_button,tripwire"
        pvp: true
```

_`<world>` indicates the name of that plotworld._

## Flag types

### BlockTypeList

A list of blocks, supporting both legacy numerical IDs and new string IDs e.g.

* `grass_block` for grass blocks
* `7` for bedrock
* `7,3` for bedrock and dirt
* `35:14,35:15` for red and black wool

These flags also support [vanilla-tags](vanilla-tags.md), like:

* `#signs` for all sign types
* `#buttons` for all button types

### Boolean

Accepts `true` or `false`.

### Double

Accepts any decimal number (all real numbers).

### Enum

Accepts a predefined collection of values.

### Integer

Accepts all integers.

### Internal

Flags used internally.

### Miscellaneous

Accept commands with multiple parameters, e.g `/gamemode creative`.

### String

Accept flags with multiple string parameters, e.g. `/plot f set greeting Welcome to my plot!`

### TeleportDeny

Accepts the follow plot membership `trusted`, `members`, `nonmembers`, `nontrusted` and `nonowners`.

### Timed

A binary tuple of numbers e.g. `53 6` or `7 93`.

## Flag Permissions

### Basic Permission Schema

To give a player access to a flag, you need to assign the following permissions, and exchange the value if wanted:

* `plots.set.flag`
* `plots.flag`
* `plots.flag.add`
* `plots.flag.remove`

{% hint style="info" %}
Also, you can assign [`plots.permpack.basicflags`](permission/permission-packs.md#plotspermpackbasicflags) to cover the following permissions and lots of the basic flags.
{% endhint %}

### Flag specific permission

`plots.set.flag.<name>.*` (e.g. `plots.set.flag.fly.*`)
The asterisk covers the values of the flag, if it's a boolean flag you cover `true` and `false`, if it's a Long flag you cover all positive numbers and so on. Make sure to decide whether you need it or not.

## Terminology

The following tables contain phrases covering certain stances of plot member inheritance and flag states. We will explain the phrases used below.

* Player: The player, as in user of the server.
* Guest: Person who is not added to the plot [tiers](plot-membership-tiers.md).
* False: The flag intended behavior is not enabled by default.
* True: The flag intended behavior is enabled by default.
* None: The flag intended behavior is not set by default.
* Infinity: The flag is not bound to an amount and allows infinite types of the flag.
* Null: The flag intended behavior cannot be set outside of the API.
* Empty: The flag variable is empty and won't appear to the user.
* Not Buyable: The flag variable is not set, therefore the plot is not buyable.
* Disabled: The flag variable is not set, therefore the intended behavior is not defined.

## Entity Categories

Flags such as mob caps, interaction flags, etc, make use of entity categories. PlotSquared divides entities in the following categories:

* **animal:** cod donkey squid skeleton_horse mule trader_llama parrot zombie_horse cow horse bee polar_bear pufferfish cat bat salmon fox pig llama iron_golem turtle tropical_fish sheep snow_golem mooshroom ocelot dolphin chicken wolf panda rabbit
