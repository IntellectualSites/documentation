## Entity Removal Brush

**/b er**: Removes all entities except itemframes and paintings within your brush size in chunks.

## The Heat Ray

**/b hr**: The Heat Ray Brush burns nearby blocks and cinders  others to a "burned" state by altering them to materials like  cobblestone, or obsidian. Try torching a village with it! The Heat Ray  Brush uses the brush size variable to widen or narrow it's beam.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Can not be undone! Also, anti-grief plugins that block explosions may nerf this brush.
{% endhint %}

## The Weather Wizard

**/vs weather**: Clears all rain and snow in the next few seconds.

## The Warp-in-Style Brush

**/b w**: This brush will warp you to the block sniped using the  arrow. The gunpowder will create a lightning bolt at the sniped block,  as well: Amaze and astound your friends! 

## The Jockey Brush

**/b jockey** This brush allows you to sit on any other player or creature. Ride a slime, or just annoy the holy hell out of someone you wish would log off. Crotch + Face = FUN!
* **-i:[y|n]** - Enables (y) or disables (n) the inverse mode. The inverse modes lets your target sit on you.
* **-po:[y|n]** - Enables (y) or disables (n) the player-only mode. If the player-only mode is enabled, only other players can used as a target.

## Three-Point Circle Brush

**Missing Image**

Three-point circle brush example 

**/b tpc accurate|default|smooth** - Use the arrow brush to select three points, which form the corners of a triangle. Use the powder brush to have VoxelSniper place the circle that circumscribes that  triangle. Works at ANY angle, although some angles work better than  others.
* **accurate|default|smooth** - Toggles how picky this brush is about placing blocks.
    * *accurate* - Only those blocks which are as close to mathematically perfect as possible.
    * *default* - A balanced mode which is generally pretty accurate, but can still leave gaps at some odd angles.
    * *smooth* - The brush will place every block that could reasonably be expected to be part of the circle. Tends to make the discs thicker. May still miss a few blocks in some worst-case scenarios, but will get most of just about any circle.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only available in versions 5.155 and higher.
{% endhint %}

## Move Brush
The Move Brush will move a selection by a specified amount of blocks. (Max 5000000 blocks)
* **/b mv x[#] y[#] z[#]** - Specifies the amount and direction the selection will be moved. (X: positive number => east, Y: positive number => up, Z: positive number => south) 
* **/b mv reset** - Resets the amount and direction to 0

## Punish Brush

This brush has its own permission: **voxelsniper.punish**

The punish brush will apply a specific punishment to everybody in the brush size radius. 

**/b p [punishment]**

You can list all available punishments by typing: **/b p info**.

Some punishments accept an additional potion level parameter. This will basically define how "intensive" the effect is and the default is 10. This is specified with **/vc [level]**. You can also define the length in seconds with **/vh [duration]**.

## Sign Overwrite Brush

The sign overwrite brush overwrites the text of signs. **/b sio**

The arrow sets one/multiple sign/signs. The powder tool will read the text of the targeted sign into the internal buffer.

Available parameters: 

* **-1 [...]** - Sets the first text line of the internal buffer. (e.g. /b sio -1 This is text.)
* **-2 [...]** - Sets the second text line of the internal buffer. (e.g. /b sio -2 This is text.) 
* **-3 [...]** - Sets the third text line of the internal buffer. (e.g. /b sio -3 This is text.)
* **-4 [...]** - Sets the fourth text line of the internal buffer. (e.g. /b sio -4 This is text.)
* **-clear** - Clears the internal buffer by setting all lines to an empty string. (Alias: -c)
* **-multiple [on|off]** - Enables or disables the ranged mode. With ranged mode enabled all sings in a box (with x=z=2*brushSize+1 and y=2*voxelHeight+1) will be set.  Keep in mind that the maximum length of a sign line is 15.

## Extrude Brush

* **/b ex**: The extrude brush will pull or push blocks in a cylinder shape, using a disk-face as a base. The height it copies to is based on your /vh <height>, the radius of the disk-face base is  based on /b # and the blocks that are extruded are based on your /vl  settings. Clicking with the arrow will "push" inwards, clicking with the gunpowder will "pull" outwards, relative to the face clicked.
* **/b ex true**: Uses a true disk for extruding.
* **/b ex false**: Turns off the true disk (default).
* **/vl**: Determines which block types get extruded.

{% hint style="info" %}
/b ex /vh 5 /b 10 /vl 1 5 *left click with gunpowder*  This would extrude all stone and wood blocks in a 10 block disk radius outward, relative to the face clicked.
{% endhint %}

## Snow cone brush
**/b snow**: Great for making snowy mountain tops. This brush only works with the gun powder and you need to click a block of snow for it to generate.
