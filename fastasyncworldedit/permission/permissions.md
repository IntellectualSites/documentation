# Permissions

{% hint style="tip" %}
For command related permissions, see [here](../main-commands-and-permissions.md).
{% endhint %}

## Admin permissions

- `fawe.admin` (allow bypassing through `/wea` command)
- `fawe.bypass` (automatically bypass WorldEdit restrictions and limits)
- `worldedit.anyblock` (bypass `disallowed-blocks` in the `worldedit-config.yml`)
- `worldedit.inventory.unrestricted` (bypass inventory restrictions if those are enabled)

## User permissions

- `fawe.limit.<limitgroup>` (Grants the user the specific group of limits. With the limitgroup `unlimited` all limits are infinite.)
- [`fawe.permpack.basic`](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit/blob/main/worldedit-bukkit/src/main/resources/plugin.yml#L31) (A bunch of WorldEdit perms which are okay to use on a creative server)
- `worldedit.navigation.jumpto.tool` (Access to the "jumpto" tool)
- `worldedit.navigation.thru.tool` (Access to the "thru" tool)

## Region permissions

FAWE by default is restricted to regions, this is useful for servers wanting to give ordinary players access to WorldEdit. To enable region restrictions, set config setting `region-restrictions` true, and give players the appropriate region permission.  If you want an admin to be able to WorldEdit anywhere using `//wea` command, give them the `fawe.admin` permission.

### WorldGuard

Restriction-Permissions if the Plugin [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard) is used.

- `fawe.worldguard` - Allow WorldGuard region owners (`/rg addowner ...`) to use WorldEdit.
- `fawe.worldguard.member` - Allow WorldGuard region members (`/rg addmember ...`) to use WorldEdit.
- `fawe.worldguardextraflags` - If you've installed [WorldGuard Extra Flags](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/4823) this permission is also used.

### PlotSquared

Restriction-Permissions if the Plugin [PlotSquared](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/77506) is used.

- `fawe.plotsquared` - Allow PlotSquared owners (`/plot setowner ...`) and trusted (`/plot trust ...`) to use WorldEdit.
- `fawe.plotsquared.member` - Allows PlotSquared members (`/plot add ...`) to use WorldEdit.
- `fawe.plotsquared.admin` - Allows WorldEdit in any PlotSquared plots (but not on roads).

{% hint style="info" %}
The `fawe.plotsquared` permission is activated by default in the [plugin.yml](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit/blob/e40a657faf993536133b2e1bbe771a5c96619bd7/worldedit-bukkit/src/main/resources/plugin.yml#L14-L17)! For a permission override it is advised to use this permission instead of the child `fawe.plotsquared.trusted` because of a higher prioritization.
