* The first line display the X and Z coordinate of your chunk.
* The two other lines display the chunk files name.

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

With kbd:[F3 + G] you see the chunk border.

### Usage
`//chunkinfo`

### Permission
`worldedit.chunkinfo`

### Distr

This command gets the distribution of blocks in the selection (picture 1) with the percentage distribution, the count and the name of this block translated in your minecraft client language.

* You can analyze the block distribution of your clipboard (e.g. after a `//copy` command) instead of your selection with using of the `-c` flag.
* With the `-d` flag the block list will separate all blocks with different blocks values (picture 2).
* With a mouse-over above the block names you see the technical names (e.g. "minecraft:oak_log") and with using of the `-d` flag the block values in squared brackets too (picture 2).
* With the optional `-p` flag and a side number you switch between the list side.

### Usage

Primary:

`//distr`

Secondary:

`//distr [-c] [-d] [-p <page>]`

1. clipboard-list number
2. cuboid size of length, height and width
3. position of your copy (important for the schematic offset)
4. amount of blocks (with AIR)

### Analyzing a schematic

![size-d_chatoutput_schematic.png](https://i.imgur.com/NqfkzeB.png)

1. schematic name
2. cuboid size of length, height and width
3. schematic offset (distance between one of the corner and your save-position)
4. amount of blocks (with AIR)
